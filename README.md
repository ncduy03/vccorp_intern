# OLTP and OLAP
| Category             | OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)                        | OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | It is well-known as an online database query management system. | It is well-known as an online database modifying system. |
| **Data source**      | Consists of historical data from various Databases.      | Consists of only operational current data.               |
| **Method used**      | It makes use of a data warehouse.                        | It makes use of a standard database management system (DBMS). |
| **Application**      | It is subject-oriented. Used for Data Mining, Analytics, Decision making, etc. | It is application-oriented. Used for business tasks.     |
| **Normalized**       | In an OLAP database, tables are not normalized.          | In an OLTP database, tables are normalized (3NF).       |
| **Usage of data**    | The data is used in planning, problem-solving, and decision-making. | The data is used to perform day-to-day fundamental operations. |
| **Task**            | It provides a multi-dimensional view of different business tasks. | It reveals a snapshot of present business tasks.        |
| **Purpose**         | It serves the purpose to extract information for analysis and decision-making. | It serves the purpose to Insert, Update, and Delete information from the database. |
| **Volume of data**   | A large amount of data is stored typically in TB, PB.    | The size of the data is relatively small as the historical data is archived in MB, and GB. |
| **Queries**         | Relatively slow as the amount of data involved is large. Queries may take hours. | Very Fast as the queries operate on 5% of the data. |
| **Update**          | The OLAP database is not often updated. As a result, data integrity is unaffected. | The data integrity constraint must be maintained in an OLTP database. |
| **Backup and Recovery** | It only needs backup from time to time as compared to OLTP. | The backup and recovery process is maintained rigorously. |
| **Processing time**  | The processing of complex queries can take a lengthy time. | It is comparatively fast in processing because of simple and straightforward queries. |
| **Types of users**   | This data is generally managed by CEO, MD, and GM.       | This data is managed by clerks and managers. |
| **Operations**      | Only read and rarely write operations.                     | Both read and write operations.                          |
| **Updates**         | With lengthy, scheduled batch operations, data is refreshed on a regular basis. | The user initiates data updates, which are brief and quick. |
| **Nature of audience** | The process is focused on the customer.                | The process is focused on the market.                   |
| **Database Design**  | Design with a focus on the subject.                      | Design that is focused on the application.              |
| **Productivity**     | Improves the efficiency of business analysts.            | Enhances the userâ€™s productivity.                       |
